      <h2>About the Mural</h2>
      <p>This page talks about the very first mural I ever created for a school that I worked for at the time. This was a completely blank canvas to start with and the first steps towards my artistic journey.</p>

      <h3>Inspiration</h3>
      <p>When I was first tasked with the project of painting a corner connected wall, I immediately thought of the classic children's character, Winnie the Pooh. His adventures in the Hundred Acre Wood have always inspired me, and I wanted to bring that magic to life in my mural.</p>
      <h3>Planning</h3>
      <p>Given the corner I decided to go with the classic storybook tree theme. I started my sketches from the corner with the base of Winnie's tree and stretched outwards towards the edges of the walls.</p>
      <h3>Experience</h3>
      <p>The entire mural took under two days to complete, from primer and sketching to fine-lining and protective coating. I had a partner who helped to complete the final touches in the last 2 hours. It was a rewarding experience to see the mural come to life and to share it with others. Especially the kids that learn there everyday!</p>
      <h3>Mural Creating Process</h3>
